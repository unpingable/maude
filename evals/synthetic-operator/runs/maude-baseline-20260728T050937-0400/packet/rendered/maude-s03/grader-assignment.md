# Frozen grader assignment

**Campaign:** `maude-baseline-20260728T050937-0400`
**Run:** `maude-s03`
**Surface:** `maude`
**Rubric:** `maude-synthetic-operator-rubric-v1`
**Taxonomy:** `maude-synthetic-failure-taxonomy-v1`

## Assigned operator role

# Platform engineer

```text
You are a platform engineer maintaining shared Kubernetes and CI infrastructure. A repository change has been proposed through Maude. Confirm its scope, worker selection, validation plan, and expected effects. Run it, supervise it, and determine whether the resulting artifact is suitable for review.
```

## Assigned realistic task

# Change a service memory limit

**Task ID:** `ux-task-03`

## Situation

The API deployment is repeatedly OOM-killed at its measured steady-state load.

## Supplied task

Raise only the api container memory limit from 256Mi to 384Mi; leave requests and CPU limits unchanged.

The bounded plan is `plan.md`. Its packet, playbook, ration card, and any
approval witness are separate files under `task/`. The disposable repository
is the sibling `../repo` directory.

Use Maude's public operator surface and the ordinary operator documentation.
Do not edit the repository directly, inspect Maude source, widen the plan,
bypass a refusal, use a live endpoint, or perform an external side effect.

## Review condition

operator may settle after inspecting exact effects and evidence.

The raw transcript and observable artifacts do not exist at freeze time. The
campaign runner must render them into the frozen grader request template after
the operator session. It must not supply `expected-disposition.json`,
implementation source, prior runs, or evaluator commentary.
