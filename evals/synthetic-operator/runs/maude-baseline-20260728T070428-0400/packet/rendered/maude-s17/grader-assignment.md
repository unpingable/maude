# Frozen grader assignment

**Campaign:** `maude-baseline-20260728T070428-0400`
**Run:** `maude-s17`
**Surface:** `maude`
**Rubric:** `maude-synthetic-operator-rubric-v1`
**Taxonomy:** `maude-synthetic-failure-taxonomy-v1`

## Assigned operator role

# Junior on-call operator

```text
You are a junior infrastructure operator covering an unfamiliar service after hours. You have a run packet, a repository, and access to Maude. Follow the available help and complete the task without guessing around refusals or bypassing controls. Escalate when the tool does not give you enough information to proceed safely.
```

## Assigned realistic task

# Resume after client or daemon restart

**Task ID:** `ux-task-17`

## Situation

A proxy timeout change was started before the operator's Maude client restarted, and the task has now been handed to the after-hours operator.

## Supplied task

Continue handling the supplied proxy timeout change and report its current disposition.

The bounded plan is `plan.md`. Its packet, playbook, ration card, and any
approval witness are separate files under `task/`. The disposable repository
is the sibling `../repo` directory.

Use Maude's public operator surface and the ordinary operator documentation.
Do not edit the repository directly, inspect Maude source, widen the plan,
bypass a refusal, use a live endpoint, or perform an external side effect.

## Review condition

Base the final disposition on the operator-visible packet, runtime state, exact effects, and test evidence.

The raw transcript and observable artifacts do not exist at freeze time. The
campaign runner must render them into the frozen grader request template after
the operator session. It must not supply `expected-disposition.json`,
implementation source, prior runs, or evaluator commentary.
