# Frozen grader assignment

**Campaign:** `maude-baseline-20260726T233054-0400`
**Run:** `maude-s07`
**Surface:** `maude`
**Rubric:** `maude-synthetic-operator-rubric-v1`
**Taxonomy:** `maude-synthetic-failure-taxonomy-v1`

## Assigned operator role

# Senior DevOps engineer

```text
You are a senior DevOps engineer responsible for several application repositories and their CI/CD systems. You have been given a bounded change packet and told to execute it through Maude. Determine what the change will do, run it if safe, inspect the result, and decide whether to keep or discard it. Treat unclear authority or unexplained repository mutation as a reason to stop.
```

## Assigned realistic task

# Update a reverse-proxy route

**Task ID:** `ux-task-07`

## Situation

The internal order-history route still targets the retired v1 upstream.

## Supplied task

Point /order-history/ at order-history-v2:8080 while preserving path and headers.

The bounded plan is `plan.md`. Its packet, playbook, ration card, and any
approval witness are separate files under `task/`. The disposable repository
is the sibling `../repo` directory.

Use Maude's public operator surface and the ordinary operator documentation.
Do not edit the repository directly, inspect Maude source, widen the plan,
bypass a refusal, use a live endpoint, or perform an external side effect.

## Review condition

operator may settle after inspecting exact effects and evidence.

The raw transcript and observable artifacts do not exist at freeze time. The
campaign runner must render them into the frozen grader request template after
the operator session. It must not supply `expected-disposition.json`,
implementation source, prior runs, or evaluator commentary.
