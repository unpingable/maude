# Frozen grader assignment

**Campaign:** `maude-baseline-20260726T233054-0400`
**Run:** `docket-s11`
**Surface:** `docket-gwr-direct`
**Rubric:** `maude-synthetic-operator-rubric-v1`
**Taxonomy:** `maude-synthetic-failure-taxonomy-v1`

## Assigned operator role

# Skeptical first-time user

```text
You are evaluating the supplied Docket/GWR surface for possible adoption by an operations team. Complete the supplied task without prior exposure to the constellation. Identify every concept the interface requires you to understand before it becomes useful, and distinguish necessary operational complexity from architecture leaking into the UX.
```

## Assigned realistic task

# Review a one-file menu image packet

**Task ID:** `ux-task-11`

## Situation

Store 17 needs a routine menu API patch, and the application team has handed off a prepared maintenance packet.

## Supplied task

Update apps/menu/deployment.yaml from menu-api:2.7.3 to menu-api:2.7.4.

The equivalent direct-runtime materials are `control.json`, `candidate.patch`,
the synthetic repository named by the control, and the Docket/GWR operator
documents under `docs/`. The supplied packet description is `task/packet.json`.
No Maude plan, playbook, ration card, or approval witness is part of this
comparison surface.

Use only the supplied Docket/GWR public CLI. Do not edit the repository
directly, widen the admitted paths, bypass a refusal, use a live endpoint, or
perform an external side effect.

## Review condition

Base the final disposition on the operator-visible packet, runtime state, exact effects, and test evidence.

The raw transcript and observable artifacts do not exist at freeze time. The
campaign runner must render them into the frozen grader request template after
the operator session. It must not supply `expected-disposition.json`,
implementation source, prior runs, or evaluator commentary.
