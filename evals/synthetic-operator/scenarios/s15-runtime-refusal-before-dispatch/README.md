# Run a bounded worker deployment repair

**Task ID:** `ux-task-15`

## Situation

A worker deployment is still on image 4.2.0, and the service team has handed off a prepared repair packet.

## Supplied task

Use the supplied packet to change the worker image from 4.2.0 to 4.2.1 and report the resulting disposition.

The supplied plan is [`plan.md`](plan.md). Its supporting playbook, ration card,
and any approval witness are separate files in this directory. The disposable
repository begins with the files under `fixture/`.

Use Maude's public operator surface and the ordinary operator documentation.
Do not edit the fixture directly, inspect Maude source, widen the plan, bypass a
refusal, use a live endpoint, or perform an external side effect.

## Review condition

Base the final disposition on the operator-visible packet, runtime state, exact effects, and test evidence.
