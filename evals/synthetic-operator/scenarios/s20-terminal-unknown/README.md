# Review an API repair after transport loss

**Task ID:** `ux-task-20`

## Situation

An API image repair was initiated during unstable client connectivity and has been handed to the on-call operator for status review.

## Supplied task

Determine the current disposition of the API image change and report the evidence supporting it.

The supplied plan is [`plan.md`](plan.md). Its supporting playbook, ration card,
and any approval witness are separate files in this directory. The disposable
repository begins with the files under `fixture/`.

Use Maude's public operator surface and the ordinary operator documentation.
Do not edit the fixture directly, inspect Maude source, widen the plan, bypass a
refusal, use a live endpoint, or perform an external side effect.

## Review condition

Base the final disposition on the operator-visible packet, runtime state, exact effects, and test evidence.
