# Update a Kubernetes deployment image

**Task ID:** `ux-task-01`

## Situation

Store 17 is serving an old menu API build after the deployment pipeline failed.

## Supplied task

Change only the menu-api container image from 2.7.3 to 2.7.4 in the Store 17 GitOps deployment.

The supplied plan is [`plan.md`](plan.md). Its supporting playbook, ration card,
and any approval witness are separate files in this directory. The disposable
repository begins with the files under `fixture/`.

Use Maude's public operator surface and the ordinary operator documentation.
Do not edit the fixture directly, inspect Maude source, widen the plan, bypass a
refusal, use a live endpoint, or perform an external side effect.

## Review condition

operator may settle after inspecting exact effects and evidence.
